Go Ident client library
=======================

This is the beginnings of a Go ident (RFC 1413) client library. Current state is that the parser
works for most cases (There are still some untested corner cases, I am sure).

The Identify and Query API interface has not been tested at all yet.

Patches are welcome. Fork the project and fire away, or send me a patch by
mail.
