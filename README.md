Go Ident client library
=======================

This is the beginnings of a Go ident (RFC 1413) client library. Current state
is that we have a crude parser that can parse the common case, but we fail a
number of corner test cases in spectacular way.

Also, we currently do not support any kind of actual query. We are currently
focusing on getting the parser up and running.

Patches are welcome. Fork the project and fire away, or send me a patch by
mail.
